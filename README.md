Titletimes
==========
The exact hour:minute:second that the title of a movie is said in the movie's dialogue.

Why? Because we really don't have anyting better to do.

Below is a list of things I want to make tests out of:

Users have to be logged in to add a Titletime
The frontpage should list all Titletimes in the database
Every Titletime should have a link to its personal page
Each Titletime page should show the Titletime, cheese factor, and movie title
The Titletimes are limited from 0 to 60 only (less for hour)
Titletimes are listed alphabetically
Only an admin can sign people up at the site
Admin can destroy any Titletimes
Users can only edit/destroy Titletimes that they made
Cannot add a second Titletime for the same movie
